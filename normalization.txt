Normalization: Process of decomposing bad relations by breaking up their attributes into smaller relations.

-> minimizing redundancy and minimizing I,D.U anomalies.

first NF
disallows multivalued attributes.
-> remove attribute and place in separate relation.
2nd NF
-> separates FFD from partial dependencies.
3rd NF
-> transitive functional dependency.

1 	3 	1 	2
3 	3 	2 	2
2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3
